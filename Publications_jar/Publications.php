<div id="description">
Abstract As a special class of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), microRNAs (miRNAs) perform important roles in numerous biological and pathological processes. The realization of miRNA functions depends largely on how miRNAs regulate specific target genes. It is therefore critical to identify, analyze, and cross-reference miRNA-target interactions to better explore and delineate miRNA functions. Semantic technologies can help in this regard. We previously developed a miRNA domain-specific application ontology, Ontology for <b> ...</b></div>

<h3>The development of non-coding RNA ontology</h3>

<div id="description">
Identification of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) has been significantly improved over the past decade. On the other hand, semantic annotation of ncRNA data is facing critical challenges due to the lack of a comprehensive ontology to serve as common data elements and data exchange standards in the field. We developed the Non-Coding RNA Ontology (NCRO) to handle this situation. By providing a formally defined ncRNA controlled vocabulary, the NCRO aims to fill a specific and highly needed niche in semantic annotation of large <b> ...</b></div>

Abstract Sinhala is one of the official languages of Sri Lanka and is used by over 19 million people. It belongs to the Indo-Aryan branch of the Indo-European languages and its origins date back to at least 2000 years. It has developed into its current form over a long period of time with influences from a wide variety of languages including Tamil, Portuguese and English. As for any other language, a WordNet is extremely important for Sinhala to take it into the digital era. This paper is based on the project to develop a WordNet for Sinhala <b> ...</b></div>

Abstract Data storage and information retrieval are some of the most important aspects when it comes to the development of a language corpus. Currently most corpora use either relational databases or indexed file systems. When selecting a data storage system, most important facts to consider are the speeds of data insertion and information retrieval. Other than the aforementioned two approaches, currently there are various database systems which have different strengths that can be more useful. This paper compares the <b> ...</b></div>

Abstract: Word lists that contain closely related sets of words is a critical requirement in machine understanding and processing of natural languages. Creating and maintaining such closely related word lists is a critical and complex process that requires human input and carried out manually in the absence of tools.

Abstract: In Natural Language Processing and Text mining related works, one of the important aspects is measuring the sentence similarity. When measuring the similarity between sentences there are three major branches which can be followed. One procedure is measuring the similarity based on the semantic structure of sentences while the other procedures are based on syntactic similarity measure and hybrid measures. Syntactic similarity based methods take into account the co-occurring words in strings. Semantic <b> ...</b></div>

Abstract: Selecting a representative vector for a set of vectors is a very common requirement in many algorithmic tasks. Traditionally, the mean or median vector is selected. Ontology classes are sets of homogeneous instance objects that can be converted to a vector space by word vector embeddings.

Abstract: Micro-blogging service Twitter is a lucrative source for data mining applications on global sentiment. But due to the omnifariousness of the subjects mentioned in each data item; it is inefficient to run a data mining algorithm on the raw data.

Abstract In various biomedical applications that collect, handle, and manipulate data, the amounts of data tend to build up and venture into the range identified as bigdata. In such occurrences, a design decision has to be taken as to what type of database would be used to handle this data. More often than not, the default and classical solution to this in the biomedical domain according to past research is relational databases. While this used to be the norm for a long while, it is evident that there is a trend to move away from relational <b> ...</b></div>
